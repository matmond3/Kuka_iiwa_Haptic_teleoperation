# Kuka_iiwa_Haptic_teleoperation
Our innovative platform uses ROS to teleoperate a KUKA iiwa robot with a Sigma 7 haptic device. The setup includes an RGBD camera and a QR code to detect the target object and its working area in the Kuka workspace. This ensures excellent flexibility for future applications.
